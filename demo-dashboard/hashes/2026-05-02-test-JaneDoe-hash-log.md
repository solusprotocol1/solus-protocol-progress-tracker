Dear Dr. Smith,

I hope this message finds you well. I'm a new patient at your clinic and would like to securely transfer my dental records from my previous dentist, Dr. Johnson at Smile Dental Care.

To ensure the records are tamper-proof and compliant with privacy standards, I'd like to use Solus Protocol to hash and anchor them on the XRPL ledger. This way, you can verify their integrity easily.

I've attached a PDF of my complete dental history (including X-rays, treatment notes, and checkup summaries from 2018-2025) for your review. Please let me know if you need any additional information or if there's a specific process at your office for this.

Thank you for your assistance — I'm looking forward to my first appointment!

Best regards,
Jane Doe
